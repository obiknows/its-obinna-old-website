excerpt: From paper to pixels, how I made the design

---

So you wanna know how I made the logo in the top left? 

Aight lemme walk you through it.

Aight, so you can just follow along if you want to but to be honest,
thats not really fun or that helpful at all.

### Materials

So you're gonna need:
- Paper
- Pencil / Pen
- Laptop (doesnt matter the OS)
- Design Software (I used Figma, link [here](https://www.figma.com/) but feel free to Photoshop if you like torture)

### 1 - Drawing on Paper

So I was heavily inspired by this book: [Tracing Memory by Clémentine Nzuji](https://www.amazon.com/Tracing-Memory-Glossary-Graphic-Symbols/dp/0660159651)

to pull symbols that had intrinsic meaning in African culture but also resembled letters as well.

*I also was inspired by the book cover for The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho*

In doing so I came up with this drawing:

and I liked what I drew so that was it. Next step, make it digital. 

### 2 - From Paper to Pixels

The next step of the design was to import the photo of the drawing to the computer and trace it so I could have a vector to use.

### 3 - Redesign, Refine, and Release
